To compile our implementation of the sinh function use the nasm (version 2.11.08) as follows:

$ nasm -f elf64 -o sinh.o sinh.asm


To use our implementation of the sinh function include the sinh.h header file like this:

#include "sinh.h"

Our signature is:

double era_sinh(double x)

so we expect a double value as input and return another double value.

When compiling your code don't forget to inculde the sinh.o object file generate by nasm for linking. 
For example if you want to compile a programm in test.c you could use the following command:

gcc -std=c11 -m64 -o test test.c sinh.o -lm

Our included test programm goes through the values from -710 to 710 in steps of 0.25 and prints the input, our result, 
the result of the build in C function and then the diviation of our result from the C function.
