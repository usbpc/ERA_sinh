To compile our implementation of the sinh function use the nasm (version 2.11.08) as follows:

$ nasm -f elf64 -o sinh.o sinh.asm


To use our implementation of the sinh function include the sinh.h header file like this:

#include "sinh.h"

Our signature is:

double era_sinh(double x)

so we expect a double value as input and return another double value.

When compiling your code don't forget to inculde the sinh.o object file generate by nasm for linking. 
For example if you want to compile a programm in test.c you could use the following command:

gcc -std=c11 -m64 -o test test.c sinh.o -lm

To compile our included test programm you first need to create a bin folder in the folder containing the makefile,
then simply run the compiled sinhtest binary in the bin folder.


Note to view the source code of sinh.asm:
Set the Tab Size in your editor to 8 to get nicely formatted code and comments.
